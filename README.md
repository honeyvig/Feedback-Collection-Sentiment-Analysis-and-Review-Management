=================
To address the job requirements and tasks mentioned, we can create a Python-based system that performs feedback collection, sentiment analysis, and recommendation system for companies in the Plant-Based & Vegan Foods, Organic Pet Food, and Organic Baby Food industries. This will automate processes to improve customer engagement, analyze feedback, and monitor brand reputation.
Key Components:

    Feedback Collection Automation:
        Automate data collection from different review platforms (Google, Yelp, Trustpilot, social media).

    Sentiment Analysis:
        Implement sentiment analysis using pre-trained machine learning models like VADER, TextBlob, or transformers for analyzing customer feedback.

    Recommendation System:
        Build a recommendation system that takes customer feedback into account to suggest relevant products or services.

    Data Visualization:
        Create dashboards to visualize customer feedback, sentiment trends, and recommendation system performance.

Python Implementation:
1. Automating Feedback Collection (from APIs like Google, Yelp, Trustpilot):

We'll start by automating the feedback collection from APIs of different platforms. We can use libraries like requests to fetch data from APIs. Some platforms may require API keys.

import requests

# Example function to get reviews from Trustpilot (using Trustpilot API)
def fetch_reviews_from_trustpilot(api_key, business_id):
    url = f'https://api.trustpilot.com/v1/business-units/{business_id}/reviews'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        reviews = response.json()['reviews']
        return reviews
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch reviews from Trustpilot")
        return []

# Example function to get reviews from Yelp API
def fetch_reviews_from_yelp(api_key, business_id):
    url = f'https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/{business_id}/reviews'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        reviews = response.json()['reviews']
        return reviews
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch reviews from Yelp")
        return []

2. Sentiment Analysis:

We can analyze the feedback using sentiment analysis tools like VADER (for general feedback) or transformers for deep learning-based sentiment analysis.

from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from textblob import TextBlob
from transformers import pipeline

# Function to analyze sentiment using VADER
def analyze_sentiment_vader(text):
    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    score = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
    return score['compound']

# Function to analyze sentiment using TextBlob
def analyze_sentiment_textblob(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    return analysis.sentiment.polarity

# Function to analyze sentiment using Hugging Face Transformers model
def analyze_sentiment_transformers(text):
    sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)
    return result[0]['label'], result[0]['score']

# Example usage
feedback = "This plant-based food is amazing, my dog loves it!"
sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment_vader(feedback)
print(f"VADER Sentiment Score: {sentiment_score}")

sentiment_score_blob = analyze_sentiment_textblob(feedback)
print(f"TextBlob Sentiment Score: {sentiment_score_blob}")

sentiment_score_transformer = analyze_sentiment_transformers(feedback)
print(f"Transformers Sentiment: {sentiment_score_transformer}")

3. Recommendation System:

We can build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering (via surprise library) or content-based filtering based on feedback and sentiment.

from surprise import SVD, Dataset, Reader
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split
from surprise import accuracy

# Example of using Collaborative Filtering with Surprise
def build_recommendation_system(data):
    # Define the data format for Surprise
    reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))  # Assume a 1-5 scale for ratings
    data = Dataset.load_from_df(data[['user_id', 'item_id', 'rating']], reader)

    trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)
    algo = SVD()
    algo.fit(trainset)
    
    # Predict ratings
    predictions = algo.test(testset)
    
    # Compute RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
    rmse = accuracy.rmse(predictions)
    print(f'RMSE: {rmse}')
    
    return algo

# Example usage
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'data' contains user-item-rating information
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'user_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'item_id': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105],
    'rating': [5, 4, 5, 3, 4]
})

recommendation_system = build_recommendation_system(data)

4. Data Visualization & Reporting:

For creating dashboards and performance summaries, we can use libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data visualization.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example function for plotting sentiment distribution
def plot_sentiment_distribution(sentiments):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(sentiments, bins=30, kde=True)
    plt.title('Sentiment Distribution of Customer Feedback')
    plt.xlabel('Sentiment Score')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
sentiment_scores = [0.8, -0.5, 0.3, 0.6, -0.1]
plot_sentiment_distribution(sentiment_scores)

5. Proactive Reputation Monitoring:

To monitor brand reputation and alert when issues arise, you can set up simple thresholds for negative sentiment scores and trigger notifications.

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_alert(subject, body, to_email):
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = 'noreply@yourdomain.com'
    msg['To'] = to_email

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.yourdomain.com') as server:
        server.login("your_username", "your_password")
        server.sendmail(msg['From'], [msg['To']], msg.as_string())

# Alerting function if sentiment score goes below threshold
def monitor_and_alert(feedback, threshold=-0.5):
    sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment_vader(feedback)
    if sentiment_score < threshold:
        send_email_alert("Negative Feedback Alert", f"Received feedback with negative sentiment: {feedback}", "admin@yourdomain.com")

# Example usage
feedback = "Terrible product! My dog hated it."
monitor_and_alert(feedback)
